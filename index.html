								<h2>Topl bridges the boundaries that keep capital locked up</h2>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-xs-12">
								<p>The idea behind Topl is simple: build the financial infrastructure necessary to bring low-cost capital to developing economies. The barriers that hinder investment into developing economies not only deprive much many regions of the capital necessary for an economy to prosper, but also block investors from accessing premier opportunities. To break down these barriers and enable low-friction investments anywhere in the world, Topl introduces a public blockchain to source and track these investments and their outcomes.</p>

					<h2>Core Components</h2>
					<div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 4vh">
						<p>Topl’s platform was designed with three defining and unique pillars:</p>
						<div class="col-xs-12"  style="margin-top:2vh">
							<h5>Our Investment Model</h5>
							Open-ended equity investments are often too risky in developing markets with inadequate liquidity, and debt can quickly stifle innovation and expansion when interest rates begin to exceed 15%. This is why Topl’s investment platform connects companies and investors through short to medium term joint ventures. We seek to align the interests of companies and investors more effectively than traditional equity or debt investments. To future reduce friction and maximize returns, contracts aren’t settled in cash, but rather through the commodity asset produced.</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12" style="margin-top:5vh">
							<h5>Commodity-Backed Stable Currency</h5>
							Currency exchange represents one of the major barriers to the global flow of capital, especially when currency pegs or volatility are involved. Instead of national fiat, Topl’s platform uses a price-stable cryptocurrency, the Poly, for all transactions. The Poly is ideal for conducting international investments because it’s is backed by a basket of universally valuable commodities, not by any one national bank or government.</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12"  style="margin-top:5vh">
							<h5>Decentralized Reputation System</h5>
							When operating across multiple business and regulatory domains, trust is a major issue between potential partners. While credit scores and financial records are good standards inside a single legal domain, they are often insufficient evidence in international transactions. To solve this problem, Topl has developed the first blockchain-based reputation system for businesses</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="process" class="wrapper light fullscreen fade-up">
				<div class="inner step">
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>Let's go through a typical investment sequence for Topl.</p>
					<ul class="actions" style="text-align:center">
						<li><a class="flow-scroll scrolly" href="#step1"><span></span>Scroll</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

								<object id="e2" data="assets/animated/animation.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
							</div>
							<div id="step1" class="row step">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Request for Investment</h2>
									<p>
										A Commodity Producer seeking funds may use Topl’s blockchain platform to find a investment partner for a joint venture.
										The Producer publishes the requested amount along with initial terms, including the commodity to be produced, project
										location, and profit share, through the peer-to-peer blockchain network to be viewed by potential investors.
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a class="button accent scrolly" href="#step2" style="margin: auto"><span></span>Continue &rightarrow;</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row step" id="step2">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Contract Negotiation</h2>
									<p>
										After an investment proposal has been submitted, potential Investors may view the proposal and summary information
										regarding the Producer. If an Investor believes they may be interested in financing the project, then they will submit
										their signature to the Producer to indicate their interest. The Producer can then decide to accept or reject the overture
										and negotiations may begin.
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a class="button accent scrolly" href="#step3" style="margin: auto"><span></span>Continue &rightarrow;</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row step" id="step3">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Signing &amp; Submission</h2>
									<p>
										Once the Producer and Investor have reached an agreement on the terms of their joint venture, only one additional step is required.
										To facilitate the disbursement of funds and handle the sale of the commodities produced, a third entity known as a Hub serves as an
										intermediary. A Hub, most often chosen for its physical proximity to the Producer, acts as an essential link between financial
										transactions on the blockchain and the movement of real goods.
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a class="button accent scrolly" href="#step4" style="margin: auto"><span></span>Continue &rightarrow;</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row step" id="step4">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Fund Transfer &amp; Disbursement</h2>
									<p>
										All transfers and account balances on the Topl blockchain are denoted in the platform’s native cryptocurrency, the Poly, which may be
										purchased either through an exchange or directly from a Hub. A signed and submitted contract proposal enters into force only with the
										transfer of the appropriate amount of Polys from the Investor into escrow administered by the contract. The contract in turn dispenses
										the funds from escrow to the Producer.
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a class="button accent scrolly" href="#step5" style="margin: auto"><span></span>Continue &rightarrow;</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row step" id="step5">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Commodity Delivery</h2>
									<p>
										After receiving the funds, the Producer begins work on satisfying the contract. Along with a schedule for delivery, the contract may specify
										either one-time or periodic shipment of a commodity to the Hub. The use of the Hub in this function serves a dual purpose: to provide the
										Producer with a streamlined mechanism to offload commodities and to allow to the Investor to remain confident in the fulfillment of the
										contract in spite of often remote geographies.
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a class="button accent scrolly" href="#step6" style="margin: auto"><span></span>Continue &rightarrow;</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row step" id="step6">
								<div class="col-xs-12">
									<h2>Contract Fulfillment &amp; Payment</h2>
									<p>
										After the Producer finishes delivery of the commodity, which must be confirmed by the Hub, the contract is considered to be fulfilled. At this
										time, the Hub will dispense Polys to the Producer and Investor based on the profit share dictated in the contract. Finally, the state of the
										blockchain will reflect this fulfilled and paid contract, and the reputation scores of all involved parties will be updated to reflect the outcome
										of the contract.
									</p>

						<h2>Features</h2>
						<p>Topl is committed to providing a secure, accessible, and powerful method to invest anywhere in the world. Based on those ideals, we’ve focused on developing these key features. </p>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-file-code-o"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Investment Smart Contract Templating</h3>
								<p>Investors and producers agree to contract terms that are enforced on the chain. These contracts automatically apply reputation modifiers and submit notifications to participants as deadlines approach and information becomes available.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-line-chart"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Integrated Reputation Tracking</h3>
								<p>Producers, investors, and hubs earn a score based on agreement outcomes. This score signals credibility, reliability, and past involvement, allowing future investors to avoid fraud, helping effective hubs gain legitimacy, and giving competitive producers leverage for improved terms.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-diamond"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Fundamentally Stable Units</h3>
								<p>Because polys are backed by a basket of commodities, their value naturally tracks the commodity market as a whole, eliminating volatility from speculation on any of the individual commodities or on the poly itself. Because Polys are backed by the production flow through the Topl platform itself, there’s also no need for a central bank to dictate monetary policy.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-exchange"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Interoperable Tokens</h3>
								<p>Polys and Arbits will both be available as standard ERC20 tokens on Ethereum as well as other chains that allow the transfer of tokenized value. The ability to move tokens between these chains and Topl will be handled through off-chain cryptographic transactions, enabling liquid markets and robust access.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-cog"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Granular Privacy Controls</h3>
								<p>Investment activities are naturally expected to be kept private. However, information needs to be accessible when potential investment arises. We enable anonymous investment agreements to coexist with the need for financial disclosure by combining an encrypted public bulletin with zkSNARK-enabled transactions. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
								<h3 class="bold">Simple, Accessible Interface</h3>
								<p>Complexity can be intimidating. The Topl client is meant to simplify network participation for basic use by abstracting away cryptographic management while also allowing power users to easily interact with the system. A well-designed graphical user interface is key to this process.</p>

									<h5 class="title">Matt Kindy  &nbsp;|  &nbsp;<span class="bold">Blockchain</span></h5>
									<p class="description">Self-taught in C programming from a young age, Matt combined his coding interests with his love of mathematics to earn a degree in Computational & Applied Mathematics at Rice University. He has worked on secure and distributed systems projects for the last 3 years on a variety of platforms, including developing and refining NIZK proofs for the JVM-based reference implementation of the STAR-Vote electronic voting system and building smart contracts in Solidity for retail payments. As a Topl blockchain developer, he is now applying his cryptographic and game-theoretic inclinations to build out a novel, multi-actor blockchain in Scala.</p>
